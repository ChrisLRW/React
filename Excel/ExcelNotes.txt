step 1: figure out excel

	Teams:
		project number : PXXXXXX (look up tales have to be unique). 
			go to pviot talbes. Click refresh
			Theres a master list, next to the toggle list (no way to remove from tables here, use columns to help), which re renders the 			main table. These are "linked tables"

percent change = bug rate before Okr - Bug rate since okr
 

to see formulas:
	power pivor -> measures

Issues => query from JIRa
Timesheets => Query from polaris 

caviots: certain numbers get named weird so some project numbers maybe harder to find 


Ideal React application: 
	timesheets
	write/read from JIRA


1.) learn the stuff
2.) write instructions in a worksheet
3.) drop in everyone general OKR
4.) shoot out an email
5.) Drop it in general also for questions

on the side we can write down ideas for React component. basing it off his Excel

Do a rought draft and ideas for components



1.) place in OKR General
2.) send an email


If you select Refresh ALL the "Bug total" worksheet will cause an error. Then itll ask you if you like to keep going, then say yes.
